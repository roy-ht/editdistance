============

Fast implementation of the edit distance(Levenshtein distance).

This library simply implements `Levenshtein distance <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levenshtein_distance>`_ with C++ and Cython.

The algorithm used in this library is proposed by
`Heikki Hyyrö, "Explaining and extending the bit-parallel approximate string matching algorithm of Myers", (2001). <http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.19.7158&rep=rep1&type=pdf>`_.

Tested on Python 2.7.5 and 3.3.2.

-------
Install
-------

You can install via pip::

    pip install editdistance


-----
Usage
-----

It's quite simple::

    >>> import editdistance
    >>> editdistance.eval('banana', 'bahama')
    2L

Simple Benchmark
----------------

With IPython, I tried several libraries:

* [pyxDamerauLevenshtein](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pyxDamerauLevenshtein)
* [pylev](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pylev)
* [python-Levenshtein](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/python-Levenshtein)

On Python 2.7.5::

    In [12]: a = 'fsffvfdsbbdfvvdavavavavavava'

    In [13]: b = 'fvdaabavvvvvadvdvavavadfsfsdafvvav'

    In [14]: import pylev

    In [15]: timeit pylev.levenshtein(a, b)
    100 loops, best of 3: 7.48 ms per loop

    In [16]: from pyxdameraulevenshtein import damerau_levenshtein_distance

    In [17]: timeit damerau_levenshtein_distance(a, b)
    100000 loops, best of 3: 11.4 µs per loop

    In [19]: timeit editdistance.eval(a, b)  # my library
    100000 loops, best of 3: 3.5 µs per loop

    In [20]: import Levenshtein

    In [21]: timeit Levenshtein.distance(a, b)
    100000 loops, best of 3: 3.21 µs per loop


------------------------
Distance with Any Object
------------------------

Above libraries only support strings.
But Sometimes other type of objects such as list of strings(words).
I support any iterable, only requires hashable object of it::

    In [22]: Levenshtein.distance(['spam', 'egg'], ['spam', 'ham'])
    ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    TypeError                                 Traceback (most recent call last)
    <ipython-input-22-3e0b30d145ac> in <module>()
    ----> 1 Levenshtein.distance(['spam', 'egg'], ['spam', 'ham'])

    TypeError: distance expected two Strings or two Unicodes

    In [29]: editdistance.eval(['spam', 'egg'], ['spam', 'ham'])
    Out[29]: 1L

So if object's hash is same, it's same.
You can provide `__hash__` method to your object instances.

Enjoy!
